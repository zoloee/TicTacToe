/**
 * A {@code Consultant} advises which move to make in an in-progress game of
 * Tic-tac-toe.
 *
 * <p>
 * Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, player X and player O, who take turns
 * marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid of Cells. The player who succeeds in placing
 * three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the
 * game. When the game has not started yet, player X is the first to make a
 * move.
 *
 * <p>
 * See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe for complete game dynamics.
 *
 * <p>
 * The consultant should advice a move following an optimal strategy, i.e. the
 * outcome of the game should lead to the best possible result for the player to
 * make a move.
 *
 * <p>
 * Winning is better than drawing is better than losing.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The consultant must adhere to the traditional rules of the game as documented
 * above.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances should provide a void (no arguments) constructor.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances of implementations of this interface are immutable.
