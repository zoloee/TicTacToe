The goal of this exercise is for you to create an implementation of the 
Consultant interface. You can use the provided class YourConsultant that needs
to be finished. We will run your solution against our unit tests. The source 
and unit tests for this project may be found in the zip file associated with 
this file.

Please read the JavaDoc carefully.

Keep in mind that:

* We are only interested in an implementation for the Consultant interface. We 
  do not, for instance, want an application that can interact with other 
  (human) players. We do not expect any kind of GUI, nor do we expect a class 
  with a main method.
 
* We are not so much looking for a solution that performs very fast. If your 
  implementation finds the best solution within a second, that is good enough.
 
* We are interested in the readability of your code.

* Follow the instructions carefully, but keep it simple! Your solution might of
  course require more files (Java types), be careful however not to 
  over-engineer your solution.
 
* You are not allowed to change existing code, i.e. do not change existing 
  files.
